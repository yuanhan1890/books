for every (a), (b), (c) all imply pattern, we can find contradiction.

(ii.)

only (b.) is subcontrary to both each other

### Ex.5

(i.)

supposed A, B is contrary, then

For all variables of A, B, if A is true, then B is false. so `A -> !B` is tautology and `!B v !A` is tautology

(ii.)

supposed A, B is subcontrary, then

A v B is tautology, then !A <-> !B is tautology, !(!A & !B) is tautology.

```
1 (1) A v B          A
2 (2) A              A
2 (3) !A -> !B       use P => !P -> Q
4 (4) B              A
4 (5) !B -> !A       same
1 (6) !A <-> !B      1,2,3,4,5 vE
```

(iii.)

(a.)

!A <-> !B <=> A <-> B

```
A B | !A <-> !B, A <-> B
T T       T         T
T F
F T
F F       T         T
```

(b.)

A & !B is inconsistent

```
A B | !(A <-> !B), (A <-> B)
T T        T           T
T F        
F T            
F F        T           T
```

### Ex.6

(i.)

```
P | a b c d
T   T T F F
F   T F T F

a. P -> P
b. P
c. !P
d. !(P -> P)
```

(ii.)

n variables, have 2^n truth values assignment patterns, then have 2 ^ (2 ^ n) truth value function.
